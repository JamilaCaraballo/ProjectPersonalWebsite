			<p id="artwords">I have been drawing for 5 years, self-teaching myself at first and then studying with a private tutor and family friend, Kalif Ausby. I have most experience in digital mediums and have worked with free programs like GIMP, Medibang Paint Pro, and Krita. Thus far I have worked with a Wacom Intuos Tablet. Despite my large experience in digital art, I won’t shy away from traditional materials like watercolors and ink. My strongest points in art are color and detail, and am willing to improve more by taking constructive criticism and solid advice. Most of my artworks are fantasy, nature, and animal themed, but am willing to expand my horizons and make clients’ descriptions come to life as accurately as I can. I also like to openly communicate with my clients, talking about ideas and exchanging unfinished artworks for discussion and possible alterations.</p>
