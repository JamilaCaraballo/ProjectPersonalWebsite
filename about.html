	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<div>
		<h2>Art Experience</h2>
		<img src="assets/imgs/art1.png">
		<img src="assets/imgs/art2.png">
		<p>I have been drawing for 5 years, self-teaching myself at first and then studying with a private tutor and family friend, Kalif Ausby. I have most experience in digital mediums and have worked with free programs like GIMP, Medibang Paint Pro, and Krita. Thus far I have worked with a Wacom Intuos Tablet. Despite my large experience in digital art, I won’t shy away from traditional materials like watercolors and ink. My strongest points in art are color and detail, and am willing to improve more by taking constructive criticism and solid advice. Most of my artworks are fantasy-themed, but am willing to expand my horizons and make clients’ descriptions come to life as accurately as I can. I also like to openly communicate with my clients, talking about ideas and exchanging unfinished artworks for discussion and possible alterations.</p>
		<h2>Web Design</h2>

		<p>I am currently a student in the OBT program in Industry City located in New York. I have been recently working on websites and learning about HTML and CSS. More will be added once my portfolio has been developed further. Thank you.</p>
